# Overview

This block identifies marker genes for each cell cluster. It runs Wilcoxon test to find genes significantly enriched in each cluster, filtering them based on fold change, adjusted p-value and the proportion of cells expressing the gene. Results for selected top markers are visualized as a dot plot. Distribution of markers gene expression is visualized with a UMAP.
